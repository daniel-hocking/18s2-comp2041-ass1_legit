14/09/18	17:00	17:45	Planning	Read through spec, systematically go through reference implementation and figure out correct output in each situation
15/09/18  16:00 17:30 Coding    Implement usage and init command, implement error checking for add command and think about how to implement rest of command
15/09/18  20:30 21:45 Coding    Finish implementation of add command, some refactoring, start to implement commit command
24/09/18  10:00 11:45 Coding    Make some changes to add command, some refactoring (save_index), implement commit and log commands
24/09/18  14:00 18:00 Coding    Implement the show command and make some changes to how index is stored, there was a bug with index storage that took hours to figure out so progress was slower than expected
24/09/18  20:45 22:15 Testing   Setup test_legit.pl and start to think about how to test things, work through a few issues with testing, create test00 and fix a few error message discrepancies
25/09/18  8:45  12:00 Testing   Added several more tests cases to test subset 0, this led to uncovering some more bugs, the main one was when a file was removed which led to a number of code changes to handle that case
25/09/18  20:45 21:30 Planning  Read through spec, systematically go through reference implementation and figure out correct output for each of the subset 1 commands
27/09/18  9:00  12:15 Refactor  Completely rework how storage of commits and index works using JSON format and overall improve code structure, split some functions into module
27/09/18  14:00 18:00 Coding    Add subset 1 functions and do a lot of debugging to get it working as expected
27/09/18  19:30 22:30 Testing   Add remaining test cases needed and fix a lot of small bugs along the way
01/10/18  8:45  9:15  Testing   Further testing and uncover a new bug, also start thinking about subset 2 and how to implement
01/10/18  9:15  11:45 Coding    Use reference implementation to create notes on subset2 and start to code up the basic parts of these functions
01/10/18  13:45 16:00 Coding    Get the branch and checkout functions working in simple cases, though still missing some checks
02/10/18  22:00 22:15 Testing   Modify tests cases to identify issue with multiple commit -m options, fix the issue
